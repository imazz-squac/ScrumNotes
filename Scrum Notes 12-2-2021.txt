Raymond:

- Something to work on: need to double check and see if two junction objects are absolutely needed. 
- doing well in creating custom objects and fields. Need to create multiple calculate fields

Miles: 

- Doing well in security, needs to double think wether or not to add additional fields and/or  objects to the data model. 

Ryan:

- Needs to work on creating valid junction objects, a little confusedn at the moment on how to improve said objects.
- Will improve by asking Jared and also reviewing junction objects as a concept overall.

Matt:

- Had trouble creating custom fields, created a custom record-type by accident and when he deleted them it messed up his playground and had to start all over again.
- Will review with Jared and try to figure out how to accurately create a custom field.
