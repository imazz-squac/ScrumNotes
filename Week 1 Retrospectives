Scrum Retrospective Week 1 (11/15-11/19)

Raymond Fajardo - Had HTML and CSS down, main issue was going through Js. A lot more JS topics, way to improve is go through topics do more of the challenges and study up on those and go over those every night. That way I have questions for Jared.

Ryan McDowell - The content last week , I had CSS down, HTML eh, but Thursday and Friday was a lot so its hard to know where I got lost and trailhead didn't help. TO improve I'll try to find alternative resources because I don't think mine and Jared's learning styles are the same.

Walter - I think it would be better to work on notetaking because more comprehensive notetaking is benenficial for how in-depth the material is. So it would better to collaborate on a Google Doc so that we could commit the topics to memory completely before the end of the week and QC. We could all take notes for each other in the QC to help each other out.

Matthew Diaz - I've started notetaking over the weekend just like it said on the How To Do Well in QC pdf and I think that now that should be prioritzed over coding challengs and beleive that now since I know that I won't fall behind because I fell behind during the Javascript topics.

Miles Foydl - I noticed honing in on the small details was easy to glaze over because practically that knowledge won't come up but it's more theoretical knowledge.
